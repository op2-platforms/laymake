# laymake

Set of AutoCAD commands to create NCS layers base on some standard preset and user inputs

is part of the lsp-ncs-layers repository

NOTE: This code includ "VsCode Snippets" for all available major and minor layers. This was done in order to quicly create or edit layer list without having to worry if the required minor layer is defined in the next lisp file. It is therefore highly recommanded that you use "Visual Studio Code" to edit the code.

Start typing "ma-", "m1-", "m2-", etc. and a list of available choice and a short description should appear.
